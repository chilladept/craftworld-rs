# Level scripts, part 7b: pod computer in use (2026-10-09)

`LevelWorld::pod_computer_in_use` backs `PodComputer.GetPodComputerInUse__` (default
false, INFERRED: nobody at the computer when the Pod loads). `level_scripts --play=N
--puter-in-use=TICK` makes it true from that tick (0 = from `OnCreate__`) and reports
`camera_before_in_use` next to the final `camera`, so one run gives both presets for the
RPCS3 comparison. `SetCameraFromToUp` floats (10, 100000, 0, 1): INFERRED near 10 and far
100000 (the PC reading); the last two are UNKNOWN. Test: `lbp-runtime`
`part6_camera_world_position_and_engine_state` (flag on and off). Counts: +0 newly
viewable, +0 newly Complete (no asset change).
