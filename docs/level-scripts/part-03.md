# Level scripts, part 3: per-tick schedule (2026-10-08)

`lbp_runtime::LevelScripts` runs a level's scripts: `create` calls `OnCreate__` on every
scripted Thing in Thing order; each `tick` resumes scripts suspended by `System.Yield` in
the order they yielded, then calls `Update__` on every scripted Thing that was not
suspended when the tick began, in Thing order. A Thing whose script faults is not run
again. `TICK_HZ` = 30 (X1). `level_scripts ... LEVEL-PATH NEW-JSON --play=N` runs create
and N ticks and reports totals (done, yielded, resumed, no function, faults), ticks with
faults, Things stopped by a fault, scripts still suspended, faults by kind, unbound
natives and `WRITE` lines.

INFERRED (each settles against RPCS3 or script behaviour):

| Rule | Choice | How it gets settled |
|---|---|---|
| Create order | Thing order, all before the first tick | Scripts that read another Thing's members in `OnCreate__` |
| Suspended `Update__` | Resumed next tick instead of a new `Update__` | Scripts that yield inside `Update__` (a loop that yields every tick behaves the same either way) |
| Update order | Thing order | RPCS3: two scripts that write the same member |
| After a fault | The Thing's script stops | Our choice; the game does not fault |

Cloud test: `schedule_creates_then_updates_and_resumes_suspended_scripts` (a class with
`Update__` that increments a member and yields: create reports no function, tick 1 runs and
yields, tick 2 only resumes, tick 3 runs again).

PC check: `cargo run -q -p lbp-runtime --example level_scripts -- <snapshot> "<game dirs>"
<Rookie Test path> local-analysis/<new>.json --play=300` (10 s). Report the printed play
line, `faults_by_kind` and the top unbound natives.
